// things to read
-- what are the forms of polymorphism in C++ and compare with Java and C#
    -java does not need method definition in interfaces, C++ does
    -both interfaces' methods will be overridden if defined in class
-- struct vs class in c++
    -struct is public access by default, class is private access
    -custom to structs used for POD(plain old data), classes used with methods
    -can make structs and class behave the same with proper syntax

create new table 
get write accessor, memwriter and memreader
push rows into it
cmemreader takes csv returns table 

-multithreading
-pointer types
- declaration of virtual functions returning pointer
-- why vector of actual types cant be used instead of vector of basetypes
